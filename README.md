#Maunz

Maunz is an IRC bot created by me with some help from bl4ckscor3 in Java using PircBotX. She is currently on multiple channels on the EsperNet IRC network and one on Freenode. Maunz can also take commands via PM and through channels she is in. If you want to help Maunz development feel free to suggest ideas on GitHub using the Issues system or if you find any, even bugs :(
