#Maunz

Maunz is an IRC bot created by me in Java 8 using PircBotX 2.0.1 with some help from bl4ckscor3. It is on multiple channels on the EsperNet IRC network with its main channel being #bl4ckscor3. Maunz can also take commands via PM and it works exactly like it would in the channel. If you want to help Maunz development feel free to suggest ideas on GitHub using the Issues system or if you find any, even bugs :(
