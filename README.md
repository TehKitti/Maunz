Maunz is an IRC bot coded by me in Java 7 using PircBotX 2.0.1 with some help from bl4ckscor3. Currently it is only for the #bl4ckscor3 channel on the EsperNet IRC network but this may change in the future. Maunz can also take commands via PM and it works exactly like it would in the channel. If you want to help Maunz development feel free to suggest ideas on GitHub using the Issues system or if you find any, even bugs :(
 
Here is a list of Maunz's commands, bolded ones cannot be done by everyone and are restricted to just me.
 
__*stop__ - Stops Maunz.
 
__*restart__ - Restarts Maunz.
 
__*enable__ - Enables Maunz.
 
__*disable__ - Disables Maunz.
 
__*ping__ - Makes Maunz respond to you with pong. Very useful for testing ping to the IRC server!
 
__*source__ - Links you to the GitHub page of Maunz, you can submit issues/pull requests here.
 
__*help__ - Links you to the page you're on right now!
 
__*say [message]__ - Makes Maunz say whatever you want her to!
 
__*accinfo [username]__ - Tells you whether or not a Minecraft account is premium!
 
__*uuid [username]__ - Will return the Minecraft UUID of the username you requested.

__*bulliedme [username]__ - Did somebody bully you? This will send them a link to stop with their bullying ways.
 
Premium account status grabbed from http://axis.iaero.me and UUID's grabbed from http://fishbans.com/docs.php
