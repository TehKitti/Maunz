Maunz is an IRC bot coded by me in Java 7 using PircBotX with some help from bl4ckscor3 too. Currently it is only for the #bl4ckscor3 channel on the Esper IRC network but this may change in the future. Maunz can also take commands via PM and it works exactly like it would in the channel. If you want to help Maunz development feel free to suggest ideas using the Issues system or if you find any, even bugs :c.

According to bl4ckscor3, Maunz is a word german people use to refer to cats sometimes but I can't find any real proof of this.

A list of Maunz's commands is here:

*stop   Stops Maunz. Only useable by TehKitti!

*restart   Restarts Maunz. Only useable by TehKitti!

*enable   Enables Maunz if she has been disabled with *disable. Only useable by TehKitti!

*disable   Disables Maunz. Only useable by TehKitti!

*ping   Makes Maunz respond to you with Pong. Very useful for testing ping to the IRC server.

*say <message>   Makes Maunz say whatever you want her to!

*accinfo <account>   Tells you whether or not a Minecraft account is premium!

*source   Links you to the GitHub page of Maunz, you can submit issues/pull requests here.

*help   Opens a help menu listing commands and other information.
